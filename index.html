        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Epicodus offers full-time courses in languages such as C#, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. Every track starts with Introduction to Programming, and includes an advanced JavaScript course, as well as two language-specific courses — four five-week sessions in total. In addition, students complete two weeks of job and internship prep and finish their studies with a five-week internship.</p>
        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
        <p>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn programming concepts faster, too.</p>
        <h3>Teacher</h3>
        <p>The Epicodus philosophy is to help students build teamwork skills and self-reliance. Our coding instructors are mostly there to help you when you're stuck or don't understand something. When you have a question, you'll start by working with your pair to figure out the answer. If the two of you can't figure out the answer, you'll ask another pair of students, as answering each other’s questions is one of the best ways to learn. If you still can't figure out the answer, our teachers are always there to help and explain. Since our teachers are Epicodus alumni themselves, they've experienced the same struggles you will, and know how best to help you through them. We have approximately 1 teacher for every 30 students.</p>
        <h3>Facility</h3>
        <p>Our classrooms are big, open spaces with lots of windows and our own kitchen. We provide giant 27" iMac computers for students to work on in class, and height-adjustable sit-stand desks. We're very close to light rail and major bus lines; there's bike parking inside; and plenty of parking lots nearby. Our offices are wheelchair accessible, and while they haven't been formally audited for accessibility, we have informally been told that they are very accessible. We are welcoming of gender diversity at Epicodus and have a policy of inclusivity in our restroom facilities.Please let us know if you have any concerns about our physical space or classroom environment.</p>
