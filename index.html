        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Epicodus offers full-time courses in languages such as C#, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. Every track starts with Introduction to Programming, and includes an advanced JavaScript course, as well as two language-specific courses — four five-week sessions in total. In addition, students complete two weeks of job and internship prep and finish their studies with a five-week internship.</p>
        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
        <p>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn programming concepts faster, too.</p>
        <h3>Teacher</h3>
        <p>The Epicodus philosophy is to help students build teamwork skills and self-reliance. Our coding instructors are mostly there to help you when you're stuck or don't understand something. When you have a question, you'll start by working with your pair to figure out the answer. If the two of you can't figure out the answer, you'll ask another pair of students, as answering each other’s questions is one of the best ways to learn. If you still can't figure out the answer, our teachers are always there to help and explain. Since our teachers are Epicodus alumni themselves, they've experienced the same struggles you will, and know how best to help you through them. We have approximately 1 teacher for every 30 students.</p>
        <h3>Facility</h3>
        <p>Our classrooms are big, open spaces with lots of windows and our own kitchen. We provide giant 27" iMac computers for students to work on in class, and height-adjustable sit-stand desks. We're very close to light rail and major bus lines; there's bike parking inside; and plenty of parking lots nearby. Our offices are wheelchair accessible, and while they haven't been formally audited for accessibility, we have informally been told that they are very accessible. We are welcoming of gender diversity at Epicodus and have a policy of inclusivity in our restroom facilities.Please let us know if you have any concerns about our physical space or classroom environment.</p>

          <h3>Hey, <span class="name"></span> I think you should choose the Ruby/Rails track course.</h3>
          <p>Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="php">
          <h3>Hey, <span class="name"></span> I think you should choose the PHP/Drupal track course.</h3>
          <p>Drupal is a free and open source content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal provides a back-end framework for at least 2.3% of all web sites worldwide – ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites. Systems also use Drupal for knowledge management and for business collaboration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="java">
          <h3>Hey, <span class="name"></span> I think you should choose the Java/Android track course.</h3>
          <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="css">
          <h3>Hey, <span class="name"></span> I think you should choose the CSS/Design track course.</h3>
          <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="csharp">
          <h3>Hey, <span class="name"></span> I think you should choose the C#/.net track course.</h3>
          <p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p>
